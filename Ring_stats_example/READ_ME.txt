This is a working example of what can be done with the ring stats code. Included are the XYZ files for whole molecule HDA ice,
as well as the oxygen-centric and hydrogen-centric versions. The original script uses a rectangular region of the persistence diagram to isolate
the characteristic regions for analysis. This example will allow users to use a polygon mask for better region isolation. Also included will be 
a text file containing the persistence diagram output, as well as text text files containing the ring statistics results.

Use the ring_stats.py script found in the main branch to run this example
